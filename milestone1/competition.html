            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>My main competition is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino_game" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>. They already have all of the information about the casino games on their website. I like how their website has lots of information and links to other things that they talk about. I also like how the information is split up into catagories by headers. Another thing I like is how the different games are on different pages so you don't have to see all the information that you don't want.</p>
